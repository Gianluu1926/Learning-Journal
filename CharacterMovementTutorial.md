This shows how to make a gameObject move up, down, left and right based on the user's input.

# 1. Player Moving

-Select the Third Person Player and add a character controller component and change the radius and height to this

This will give us a nice character controller collider

# 2. Create a new script

-Start by adding another component called ThirdPersonMovement script

We are going to create a public float called "speed", save it and then we are going to attach the script to the 3D Object.
